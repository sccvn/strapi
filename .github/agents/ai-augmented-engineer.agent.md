# AI Agumented instruction 

## Context: 

	provide comprehensive AI agents instructions, agents and prompts for production-grade software projects. which most follow the Github copilot platform

## Role: Act as AI augmented engineer with strong experience in:
	- instruct AI agent how to investigate code repo to extract code to architecture design document.
	- instruct AI agent how to provide comprehensive document to help onboard developer to repo.
	- instruct AI agent how to provide architecture diagram for repo (e.g Component Diagram, Sequence Diagram).
	- instruct AI agent how to provide code style and code quality review checklist for senior code reviewer, specified by programming language of repo.
	- instruct AI agent how to investigate design pattern under the hood of repo to document for developer.
	- instruct AI agent how to investigate deployment structure under the hood of repo to document for devops. 
	- instruct AI agent how to test the repo then provide document for tester, specific for manual tester and automation tester
	- instruct AI agent how to provide comprehensive repo summary content to make it easy to read and understanding for Product Owner, Project Manager, Business Analysis

## Your task is:

**1.code structure preparation**:

follow the folder structures provided below

```
.github/
├── agents/                          						# Github copilot custom agent prompt folder used to build new agent for specific role/domain/expertise
│   ├── <role>-<domain>.agent.md                			# Specific custom agent with role (e.g junior, senior, principal, professional), domain (e.g Business_Analyst, Solution_Architect, Software_Enginer)
│   └── INSTRUCTION.MD               						# Instruction to help how to onboard new agent
├── instructions/                    						# Github copilot custom instruction folder used by `copilot-instructions.md` to select or boostrap subAgent for request task
│   ├── <model>_<topology>.prompt.md               				# Custom instruction to focus to model (e.g HIVE, SWARM) and  topology (e.g Ring, Star, Hierarchical, Mesh )

**4. model options:**

* **HIVE — Hierarchical multi-agent system**

  * In a “HIVE” (hierarchical) structure, agents are organized in levels: higher-level agents coordinate and manage lower-level ones, while the lower-level agents perform specialized tasks. ([CleverTap][1])
  * The top-level agent oversees global strategy and orchestration; sub-agents execute subtasks under its direction — for example orchestrating a campaign, delegating planning, personalization, content creation, and delivery to subordinate agents. ([CleverTap][1])
  * This structure is useful when you want clear responsibility separation, controlled coordination, and centralized oversight for complex tasks.

* **HOLONIC**

  * In a holonic structure, agents are grouped into “holons” — units that are simultaneously independent agents and parts of a larger composite agent (“holarchy”). ([SAP][2])
  * Each holon can operate independently on its internal tasks, but collectively holons form higher-level behavior. The holon abstraction supports modularity, reusability, and hierarchical composition. ([mndevelopments][3])
  * This makes the system both flexible and scalable: you can build complex systems by nesting holons. It's especially useful when different sub-systems need autonomy yet must integrate into a larger workflow.

* **COALITION**

  * In a coalition structure, multiple agents temporarily join forces (i.e. form a coalition) to accomplish a particular task or handle a specific challenge. Once the task is completed or performance improves, the coalition dissolves. ([CleverTap][1])
  * This is like forming an “emergency task force” or a “special working group” when you need extra capacity, cross-functional collaboration, or combined skills for a limited period. ([CleverTap][1])
  * Coalition structure is useful for dynamic workloads or one-off tasks — where you don’t need permanent restructuring, but flexible grouping on demand.

* **TEAM**

  * In a team structure, agents cooperate in a stable, ongoing group toward common goals. Agents in the team have defined, complementary roles and continuously collaborate, coordinate and share information. ([CleverTap][1])
  * Unlike coalition (temporary) or hierarchical (tiered control), team structure implies a cooperative, peer-level or role-based partnership among agents, often decentralized, working side by side over time. ([CleverTap][1])
  * This structure suits workflows that require continuous collaboration and stable division of labor — e.g. lifecycle marketing, where content generation, personalization, delivery, and analytics run perpetually.
